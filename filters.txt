cv.GaussianBlur

The cv.GaussianBlur function applies a Gaussian blur to an image. A Gaussian blur is a linear filter that smoothes an image by convolving it with a Gaussian kernel. Here are the most important parameters:

    src: The input image to be blurred.
    ksize: The size of the kernel used for blurring. This parameter should be an odd integer, and a larger value will result in a stronger blur.
    sigmaX: The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in the x direction. This parameter controls the amount of smoothing in the x direction, and a larger value will result in a stronger blur.
    sigmaY: The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in the y direction. This parameter controls the amount of smoothing in the y direction, and a larger value will result in a stronger blur.

By adjusting the ksize, sigmaX, and sigmaY parameters, you can control the degree of smoothing and the size of the details that are preserved or removed.
cv.bilateralFilter

The cv.bilateralFilter function is a non-linear filter that is used to smooth an image while preserving edges. It is a slower algorithm compared to Gaussian blur, but it provides better edge preservation. Here are the most important parameters:

    src: The input image to be smoothed.
    d: The diameter of each pixel neighborhood used during filtering. A larger value will result in a stronger blur.
    sigmaColor: The standard deviation of the color space used during filtering. This parameter controls the degree to which pixels with similar colors are considered to be part of the same region.
    sigmaSpace: The standard deviation of the coordinate space used during filtering. This parameter controls the degree to which pixels with nearby coordinates are considered to be part of the same region.

By adjusting the d, sigmaColor, and sigmaSpace parameters, you can control the degree of smoothing and the degree of edge preservation. A higher value of sigmaColor will result in more colors being treated as the same, and a higher value of sigmaSpace will result in more pixels being treated as the same.
