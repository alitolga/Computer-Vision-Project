1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For the first 4 seconds, we flick between grayscale and colored frames.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
2 seconds of Gaussian with ksize=5 and 2 seconds with ksize=7

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
2 seconds of bilateral with ksize=7 and 2 seconds with ksize=9
Each second we also switch between high and low sigmaColor and sigmaSpace

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
4 seconds of RGB masking and 4 seconds of HSV masking. The HSV visibly works better.
Plus, at the last 2 seconds of each, we apply closed morphing which slightly increases performance.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sobel Edge detection with color and grayscale.
After 1 second, we increase the scale at the colored one and the delta in the grayscale one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hough circle detection. Every 2 seconds, we tweak with parameters.
We do too high min radius, too low max radius, high param1, high param2
and the ideal parameters.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We apply template matching.
The whiteness of the rectangle changes with the likelihood.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:59,900
Carte blanche. We replace the ball with the image of the president,
we change the color of the ball and we make copies of it.
